I played around with Web-MIDI and a custom UI Design and created a keyboard trainer application based on Ionic 5.

Upright piano KW (sounds)
====

The sounds in this applications are from a free sound bank:

>This sound bank has been created from a Kawai upright piano, located in a
>living room. Thanks to Inma MartÃ­nez de Miguel for kindly letting us access to
>her home to play and record the piano.
> 
>It was recorded by Gonzalo <humanogonzalo@gmail.com> and Roberto
><roberto@zenvoid.org> on January 2017, using a Zoom H1 portable recorder
>mounted on a tripod in front of the piano, approximately at the place where
>the head of a piano player would be.
>
>The raw recordings were cropped, edited, and processed by Roberto, using free
>software programs. This sound bank, in several formats and qualities, is
>available on the FreePats project web pages:

Known Issues
---

* Some animation issues
   * All the custom animations stress flex to its limits i think
   * On the play page there are a lot of panels (it lags a bit with everything on) 
     * -> investigate -> its getting better! -> probly piano roll as flex is troublesome...
   * Might be fixed with the styles clean up
* Having the options in the menu is quite nice but it is in the dom the whole time
   * As popover it would be lazy loaded but its not so nice  
   * Also having all the options available at the same time might be a bit much
   * Still dont know about Setter and Getter pattern

TODO
---
* clean up styles
  * Animation Performance
* add more lessons
